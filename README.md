# The Gossip Project

This exercise has been made with PostgreSQL and published in Heroku, by myself with the support of my team ( THP-NICE), in order to learn basics ruby on rails ( especially routes configuration and controllers, models and views use)

This website allows us to visualize gossips ( gossip model generated by Faker ). A navbar allows us a redirection to the Home Page, but also to the Contact Page and Team Page. Each Gossip is clickable and permits to visualize the gossip in a dedicated webpage.
The Design has been made in CSS and Bootstrap ( for Navbar and Cards )

To check the model : db
To check the controller : app > controllers
To check roads : config
To check views : app > views > static_page

Enjoy !
